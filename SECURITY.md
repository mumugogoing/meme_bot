# Security Warnings and Best Practices

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

### Financial Risk
- **Cryptocurrency trading carries EXTREME risk of loss**
- **Meme coins are HIGHLY speculative and volatile**
- **You can lose 100% of your investment**
- **Only trade with money you can afford to lose completely**
- **Past performance does NOT guarantee future results**

### Software Disclaimer
- This is EXPERIMENTAL software
- NO WARRANTIES of any kind
- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
- Authors are NOT responsible for any losses
- This is NOT financial advice

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Private Key Management

**❌ NEVER:**
- Commit private keys to Git
- Store private keys in plain text
- Share private keys with anyone
- Use production keys in development

**✅ ALWAYS:**
- Use environment variables
- Consider hardware wallets
- Use KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
- Use OKX Wallet SDK when possible
- Rotate keys regularly

**Example - Secure Key Loading:**
```go
// Load from environment variable
privateKey := os.Getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")

// Or use KMS
// privateKey := kms.GetSecret("trading-bot-key")
```

### 2. Testing Before Production

**Required Testing Steps:**

1. **Dry-Run Mode (Minimum 24 hours)**
   ```bash
   DRY_RUN=true
   AUTO_EXECUTE=false
   ```
   - Monitor token discovery
   - Verify safety checks
   - Review candidate selections
   - Check strategy decisions

2. **Testnet Testing**
   - Use Solana devnet
   - Use Base testnet
   - Test all functionality
   - Verify transaction execution

3. **Small Amount Testing**
   ```bash
   ACCOUNT_BALANCE=100    # $100 only
   SINGLE_POSITION_PCT=0.05  # 5% = $5 per trade
   DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT=10    # $10 max loss
   ```
   - Run for 1 week minimum
   - Monitor closely
   - Review all trades
   - Adjust strategy based on results

### 3. Configuration Security

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# ✅ Good - Use .env file (add to .gitignore)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secrets

# ❌ Bad - Hard-coded in code
const privateKey = "0x123..." // NEVER DO THIS
```

**Gitignore:**
```
.env
*.key
*.pem
secrets/
```

### 4. RPC Endpoint Security

**Use Authenticated Endpoints:**
```bash
# ✅ Good - Private endpoint with API key
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://your-private-node.com?api-key=xxx

# ❌ Risky - Public endpoint (rate limits, reliability issues)
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Respect provider rate limits
- Implement exponential backoff
- Use multiple providers as fallback
- Monitor for abuse

### 5. Access Control

**API Security:**
```go
// Add authentication to API endpoints
router.Use(authMiddleware)

// Restrict sensitive operations
router.HandleFunc("/api/risk/resume", requireAdmin(resumeTradingHandler))
```

**Network Security:**
- Run behind firewall
- Use VPN for remote access
- Enable HTTPS for API
- Restrict API access by IP

### 6. Monitoring and Alerts

**Set Up Alerts For:**
- Circuit breaker triggered
- Execution failures > 3 in a row
- RPC connection issues
- Unusual token patterns
- Daily loss approaching limit
- API errors

**Example Alert Configuration:**
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: circuit_breaker
    condition: trading_halted == true
    action: send_discord_notification
  
  - name: high_loss
    condition: daily_loss > daily_loss_limit * 0.8
    action: send_email
```

### 7. Transaction Security

**Before Broadcasting:**
- Simulate transaction first
- Verify gas/fees
- Check slippage tolerance
- Confirm recipient address
- Validate amount

**After Broadcasting:**
- Wait for confirmations (2+ recommended)
- Handle reorgs
- Retry on failure with exponential backoff
- Log all transaction details

### 8. Audit Trail

**Required Logging:**
```go
log.Printf("TRADE_EXECUTED: token=%s, amount=%.2f, tx=%s", 
    token, amount, txHash)
log.Printf("SAFETY_CHECK: token=%s, honeypot_score=%.2f, can_sell=%v",
    token, score, canSell)
log.Printf("RISK_CHECK: exposure=%.2f, limit=%.2f, approved=%v",
    exposure, limit, approved)
```

**Store:**
- All safety reports
- All strategy decisions
- All execution results
- All risk decisions
- Transaction receipts

### 9. Incident Response

**If Something Goes Wrong:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Stop the bot (`Ctrl+C` or API call)
   - Check account balances
   - Review recent transactions
   - Secure any exposed keys

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review logs
   - Check metrics
   - Identify root cause
   - Assess damage

3. **Recovery:**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Change keys if compromised
   - Resume trading cautiously
   - Monitor closely

4. **Prevention:**
   - Document incident
   - Update procedures
   - Improve monitoring
   - Add safeguards

### 10. Compliance and Legal

**Know Your Obligations:**
- Tax reporting requirements
- Local cryptocurrency regulations
- Trading platform terms of service
- Data protection laws (GDPR, etc.)

**Tax Considerations:**
- Every trade may be taxable
- Track cost basis
- Report gains/losses
- Consult tax professional

**Regulatory:**
- Check if automated trading is legal in your jurisdiction
- Understand securities laws
- Know KYC/AML requirements
- Follow exchange rules

## Honeypot and Scam Prevention

### Common Scam Patterns

**Red Flags:**
- Cannot sell after buying
- High tax fees (>20%)
- Ownership not renounced
- Liquidity not locked
- Suspicious contract patterns
- Social media hype campaigns
- "Guaranteed returns" claims

**Bot Protection:**
- Honeypot score threshold (0.2 default)
- Simulated sell before buy
- Transfer restriction checks
- Owner control analysis
- Blacklist system

### Manual Verification

Even with automation:
- Review high-value candidates manually
- Check contract on explorers
- Research team/project
- Look for red flags
- Trust your judgment

## Recommended Setup

### Development Environment
```bash
DRY_RUN=true
AUTO_EXECUTE=false
ACCOUNT_BALANCE=10000  # Virtual balance
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
# Use testnet
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
BASE_RPC_URL=https://goerli.base.org
DRY_RUN=false
ACCOUNT_BALANCE=100
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Minimal amounts initially
DRY_RUN=false
AUTO_EXECUTE=true
ACCOUNT_BALANCE=1000      # Start small
SINGLE_POSITION_PCT=0.01  # 1% = $10
TOTAL_EXPOSURE_PCT=0.05   # 5% = $50
DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT=50       # $50 max
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Stop Trading Immediately
```bash
# Option 1: API call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/risk/halt

# Option 2: Kill process
pkill -f trading

# Option 3: Ctrl+C in terminal
```

### Check System Status
```bash
# View metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/metrics

# Check risk status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/risk

# Review candidates
curl http://localhost:8080/api/candidates
```

### Secure Compromised Keys
```bash
# 1. Stop the bot
# 2. Generate new keys
# 3. Transfer funds to new address
# 4. Update configuration
# 5. Rotate API keys
# 6. Review access logs
```
